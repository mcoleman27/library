To write and upload code use https://codewith.mu/.  Alternatively, the online editor https://python.microbit.org will let you download a hex files which can then be dragged and dropped onto the micro bit USB drive.

If you copy and paste code from this repo, make sure you're viewing the raw file, not the normal html view which may have hidden funny characters.
